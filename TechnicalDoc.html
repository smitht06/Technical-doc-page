                Java is a general-purpose programming language that is class-based,
                object-oriented (although not a pure OO language, as it contains
                primitive types), and designed to have as few implementation
                dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers
                write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code
                can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.
                Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can
                run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying
                computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++,
                but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them.
                As of 2018, Java was one of the most popular programming
                languages in use according to GitHub, particularly for
                client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.

        JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different
        in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have
        Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most
        Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow
        constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to
        JavaScript.
      </p>

      <p>
        In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by
        declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small
        number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values.
        JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common
        class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic
        inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects.
        JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative
        requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as
        loosely typed methods.
      </p>
      <p>
        JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not
        have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to
        be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and
        you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and
        function return types are not explicitly typed.

            A variable is a container which holds the value while the java program is executed. A variable is assigned with a datatype.
            Variable is a name of memory location. There are three types of variables in java: local, instance and static.
            There are two types of data types in java: primitive and non-primitive. Please see the example of variables below:
        </p>
            <p><code>int a = 1; float b = 2.2 boolean c = true;</code></p>

                Java is a strongly typed programming language. This means that every variable must have a data type associated with it.
                For example, a variable could be declared to use one of the eight primitive data types: byte, short, int, long, float, double, char or boolean.
                A good analogy for a variable is to think of a bucket. We can fill it to a certain level, we can replace what's inside it, and sometimes we can add or take
                something away from it. When we declare a variable to use a data type it's like putting a label on the bucket that says what it can be filled with.
                Let's say the label for the bucket is "Sand". Once the label is attached, we can only ever add or remove sand from the bucket. Anytime we try and put anything
                else into it, we will get stopped by the bucket police. In Java, you can think of the compiler as the bucket police. It ensures that programmers declare and use variables properly.
                To declare a variable in Java, all that is needed is the data type followed by the variable name:
            </p>
            <p><code>int numberOfVariables;</code></p>

    <selection class="main-section" id="Variable_scope">
        <header>Variable scope</header>
        <article>
            <p>
                When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a
        global variable, because it is available to any other code in the
        current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is
        called a local variable, because it is available only within that
        function.

            <p>
                If you have experience with other programming languages, such as C and C++, you have probably used global variables. A global variable is one that is accessible to
                all parts of a program and is usually declared as part of the first lines of code.
                Java doesn't technically support global variables. As a pure object-oriented language,
                everything needs to be part of a class. The reason is to protect data and members of classes from being changed,
                inadvertently or on purpose, by other parts of the program.
                However, you still may need to have variables that can be accessed across your program, and not confined to specific classes.

            <code>public class Openclass {
                public static double price = 15.24;
                public static long pages = 1053;
}</code></p>

                A constant is a variable whose value cannot change once it has
                been assigned. Java doesn't have built-in support for constants,
                but the variable modifiers static and final can be used to effectively create one.
                Constants can make your program more easily read
                and understood by others. In addition, a constant is cached by the JVM as well as your application, so using a constant can improve performance.
